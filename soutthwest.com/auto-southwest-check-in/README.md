## Github Action pricing
Currenty Github Action for a public repository (where anyone can see your code) is FREE:

https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions

```
GitHub Actions usage is free for standard GitHub-hosted runners in public repositories, and for self-hosted runners
```

This means it is all free to run.  

It is safe to run this in the public b/c your username and passwords are in the Github Secrets.  It does show your
name in the Github Action logs though.
